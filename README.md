# thesis-project

I don't have IT background, so this is my first Software Engineering thesis.

This project primarily involves web scraping Chinese information from a travel website to gather data. It utilizes cosine similarity for recommending tourist attractions and implements a web interface using Streamlit. Lastly, it compares translation results using the DeepL API. The conclusion drawn is that DeepL performs most effectively in translating English text, demonstrating the best results.
